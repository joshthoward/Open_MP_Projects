This project was completed for the Georgia Institute of Technology High Performance Computing (CSE 6221) course. The authorship of Patrick Flick <patrick.flick@gmail.com> and corresponding copywrite belonging to the Georgia Institute of Technology is established for the project organization and outline. All subroutines and files not containing copywrite have been implemented by Joshua Howard <joshthoward@gmail.com> in completion of this course. 

The jacobi.cpp, mpi_jacobi.cpp, main.cpp, and utils_jacobi.cpp files and their respective header files correspond to the parallel implementation of Jacobi's iterative method to solve a system of linear equations. This method is only convergent for diagonally dominant systems, and therefore will not always converge.
