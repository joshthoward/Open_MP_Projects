This folder includes two projects completed for the Georgia Institute of Technology High Performance Computing (CSE 6221) course. The authorship of Patrick Flick <patrick.flick@gmail.com> and corresponding copywrite belonging to the Georgia Institute of Technology is established for the project organization and outline. All subroutines have been implemented by Joshua Howard <joshthoward@gmail.com> in completion of this course. 

The Jacobi.cpp, MPI_Jacobi.cpp, Main_Jacobi.cpp, and utils.cpp files and their respective header files correspond to the parallel implementation of Jacobi's iterative method to solve a system of linear equations. This method is only convergent for diagonally dominant systems, and therefore will not always converge.
